# AR-NewGame---Shooter

ARShooter is an open source Augmented Reality shooter made with ARKit and written in Swift. Hence, it is only useable with iOS 11.
This is an AR shooting game that challenges the shooting experience in different real environments.
game introduction:
Players can shoot at the targets to destory them by aiming the crosshair and tapping on the screen. When a target is destroyed, another one spawns shortly after. In the event a target spawns outside the current view of the player, location indicators flash on the bottom of the screen to guide the player towards the location of the target.
